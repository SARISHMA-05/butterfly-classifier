# 🦋 Butterfly Species Classifier

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model to identify different species of butterflies using **Transfer Learning**. It is implemented in a Google Colab notebook and trained on a publicly available dataset.

## 📁 About the Project

- Built using TensorFlow/Keras and transfer learning (e.g., MobileNetV2 / VGG16).
- Uses a butterfly dataset with multiple species.
- Provides predictions with confidence scores.
- Fully runnable in **Google Colab**.
